Like in SQL, we create schemas (look in models/User) using mongoose
Mongoose is a MongoDB object modelling tool to work in an asynchronous environment

By creating the schema, we can pass it into the mongoose.model which allows us to export that model
and use functions.

We then use the model in the appropriate controller
