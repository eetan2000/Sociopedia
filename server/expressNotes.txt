~~Routing~~
Routing determines how an application responds to a client request to a particular endpoint.
Endpoints include a URI (path) and a specific HTTP request (CRUD)
Route definition takes the following structure:

app.METHOD(PATH, HANDLER)

where 
app is an instance of express
METHOD is an HTTP CRUD method 
PATH is a path on server
HANDLER is the function executed when route is matched



~~Static Files~~
To serve static files, use express.static


~~MiddleWare~~
Express apps are essentially a series of 'middleware' calls
Middleware functions have access to the request and response object (req, res) and the next middleware's
function.
Middleware can perform:
    Execute code
    Make changes to req,res
    End the req,res cycle
    Call the next middleware function in the stack

To bind middleware, use app.use()
This is has no mount path. So it will execute everytime an app receives a request

        app.use((req, res, next) => {
        console.log('Time:', Date.now())
        next()
        })
